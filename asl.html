    <h1>About ASL</h1>

    <p>ASL is a complete visual language with its own grammar and rules. It is expressed through hand shapes, facial
        expressions, and body movements.</p>

    <p>ASL is not a form of pantomime. It has its own syntax and structure, just like spoken languages.</p>

    <p>ASL is used by over half a million people in the United States and Canada. It is the 4th most commonly used
        language in the US.</p>
