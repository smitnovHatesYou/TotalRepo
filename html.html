         * DISCLAIMER: I slightly adapted this code for the homework assignment.  If you would like 
         * the original source I will provide it after you have turned in your assignment.
         * 
         * Modify this method to make the body of the ball a random color.  Use the Random function
         * Math.random() 
         * Use this for help with random
         * https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_random.asp
         * 
         * The color returned should be a css color string that looks like:
         * "rgba(0,0,0)"
         * Where the first 0 is the red component with a number from 0 to 255
         * Where the second 0 is the green component with a number from 0 to 255
         * Where the third 0 is the blue component with a number from 0 to 255

         * You can make a copy of this code and play with it.  Answer the 
         * following questions 
         * 
         * Easy:
         * 1) What happens if you make gravity 10?  What happens if you make 
         * gravity .09?  What line(s) of code do you need to change, and how do
         * you change them?  Show the new line(s) that you wrote.
         * 
         * Answer on the comment on lines 89-93
         * 
         * 2) What line(s) of code do you need to change to make the balls all
         * start from the same place, and how do you change those lines?  Show 
         * the new line(s) that you wrote.
         * 
         * Answer at the ending comment on line 112
         * 
         * 3) How can you change the number of balls that are created?  What 
         * line(s) of code do you need to change, and how do you change them?  
         * Show the new line(s) that you wrote.
         * 
         * Answer on comment on line 128 & 129
         * 
         * 4) A little harder: How can you make the balls go very slow or very
         * fast?  What line(s) of code do you need to change, and how do you 
         * change them?  Show the new line(s) that you wrote.
         * 
         * Answer on the comment on line #117
         * 
         * 5) Challenging: Haw can you turn the balls into boxes?  You will 
         * need https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/canvas_rect.asp.  What line(s) 
         * of code do you need to change, and how do you change them?  Show the
         * new line(s) that you wrote.
